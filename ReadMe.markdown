# What's In the Repository
This repository contains a makefile and some code (src/main.c) for the Teensy Dev
Board, with TODO's which should be filled in to complete the lesson.

After the code is complete, it can be built by typing `make` into the
terminal.

For more information about building and flashing code to the Teensy2++,

The repostiory also contains a solution to the lesson, in the solution
directory. You can use this solution to check your work.

# Want to try your solution?
If you don't have access to a Teensy2++ device, bring your completed
code to the next meetup! We have them in our inventory and you can
borrow one to give your solution a try.
